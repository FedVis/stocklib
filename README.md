python 2.7 library for financial indicators on stock and futures quotes

I create this library for a work I made for the end of my university's course in statistical analisys of financial market in 2004.
It's deprecated but still work with python 2.7 and it's useful to see how I calculate various tecnical analisys indicators such as
stochastic, RSI, CCI, Sar, MACD and so on
